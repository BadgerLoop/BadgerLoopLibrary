* Getting started
-----------------

If you obtained these sources from the SVN repository, start by building the 'configure' script:

	autoreconf

Then, build the library and demo code:

	make clean
	make


* Demonstration
---------------

Look at src/dev/README and src/dev/demo.c for demonstration source code. Simple examples can be run by using the following command :

	cd src/dev
	./buspirate-demo /dev/tty.usbserial 8

where the first argument is the name of the serial device that corresponds to the Bus Pirate (typically /dev/ttysomething under UNIX and COMx under Windows).
